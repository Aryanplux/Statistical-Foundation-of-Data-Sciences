# Practical 10 — Wine Dataset Exploratory Analysis & Visualization

**Course:** CSU1658 – Statistical Foundation of Data Sciences  
**Student:** Aryan Dhiman  
**Date:** November 2025

## Overview

This notebook presents a comprehensive exploratory analysis and visualization of the Wine dataset, with the following objectives:

- Display basic statistics of wine features
- Boxplot visualization by wine class label
- Scatterplot examination of variable relationships
- Covariance matrix heatmap
- Data scaling and normalization
- Class separation using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

---

## Main Steps

1. **Basic Statistics:**  
   - Displayed summary statistics (mean, std, min, max, etc.) using `describe()` from pandas.

2. **Boxplot by Output Labels/Classes:**  
   - Boxplots differentiate feature distributions across wine classes.

3. **Scatterplot of Two Variables:**  
   - Visualizes relationships and clustering between selected wine features.

4. **Covariance Matrix Visualization:**  
   - Plots a heatmap of feature covariances using the pandas & seaborn libraries.

5. **Data Scaling:**  
   - Standardizes features using scikit-learn’s StandardScaler for robust comparisons and subsequent PCA.

6. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**  
   - Reduces dimensionality and visualizes enhanced class separation in 2D space with PCA, helping to see wine class clusters more clearly.
