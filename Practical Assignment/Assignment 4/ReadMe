## Overview

This repository contains solutions and analysis for the Student Rating Dataset. It answers statistical and visualization tasks related to professor tenure, minority status, age, and plotting different variable types in Python using Jupyter Notebook.


## Tasks Addressed

1. **Tenure & Minority Status:**  
   Calculate % of visible minorities who are tenured. Perform significance test for tenure by minority status.
2. **Age by Tenure:**  
   Mean and standard deviation of age for tenured and untenured professors.
3. **Best Age Visualization:**  
   Compare histogram and box plot for age variable and recommend use.
4. **Bar vs Barh (Gender):**  
   Explain the difference and show both vertical and horizontal bar charts using gender variable.
5. **Tenured Professors Evaluation:**  
   Calculate median evaluation score for tenured group.
