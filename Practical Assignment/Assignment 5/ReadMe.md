##  Overview

This repository presents solutions for probability and statistical hypothesis testing using the teachers' rating dataset. The notebook includes real-data probability estimation and a two-tailed z-test scenario based on a sports analytics context.

##  Assignment Tasks

1. **Probability (Eval > 4.5):**
   - Compute P(score > 4.5) for evaluation scores.

2. **Probability (3.5 < Eval < 4.2):**
   - Compute P(3.5 < score < 4.2) using real data.

3. **Two-Tailed Z-Test (Sports Mean):**
   - Null hypothesis: Regional basketball mean equals historic (pro) mean.
   - Alternative: Regional mean differs from historic mean.
   - Calculate z-score, two-tail p-value, and interpret at α = 0.05.

## Methods Used

- pandas, numpy: data prep/statistics
- scipy.stats: normal distribution, p-values
- matplotlib: optional z-test visualization

---

##  Results

- All answers shown and interpreted in the notebook
- Tested and commented probability and hypothesis testing code
