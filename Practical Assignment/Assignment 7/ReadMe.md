##  Overview

This project applies regression and correlation analysis to the Teaching Ratings dataset.  
Assignment tasks include OLS regression (with T-test and ANOVA) and examining correlations to answer core data analysis questions about teaching evaluations.

---


##  Assignment Tasks

1. **Regression with T-test:**  
   Does gender affect teaching evaluation rates? (OLS regression: score ~ gender)

2. **Regression with ANOVA:**  
   Does beauty score for instructors differ by age? (ANOVA: beauty ~ age group)

3. **Correlation:**  
   Is teaching evaluation score correlated with beauty score? (OLS regression: score ~ beauty)

---

##  Methods Used

- pandas, numpy for data handling
- statsmodels (OLS, ANOVA)
- scipy, matplotlib, seaborn for analysis and visuals

---

##  Results

- OLS regression coefficients, p-values, and detailed model outputs
- ANOVA table for age group and beauty score
- Statistical results and commentary after each question
